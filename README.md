# AAPL-Apple-stock-price-prediction-
"Time-series forecasting of Apple (AAPL) stock prices using Linear Regression and LSTM in Python."
This project predicts Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock prices using historical market data and Machine Learning models â€” specifically Linear Regression and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks.

ðŸš€ Project Overview

Goal: Forecast future AAPL stock closing prices using time-series analysis.

Models Used:

Linear Regression â†’ Simple, interpretable baseline.

LSTM Neural Network â†’ Captures temporal dependencies and complex patterns.

Evaluation Metric: Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

Visualization: Actual vs. Predicted prices plotted for easy comparison.

ðŸ“Š Workflow

Data Collection â€“ Imported historical AAPL stock data.

Data Preprocessing â€“ Cleaned missing values, normalized features, created lag variables.

Model Training â€“ Built and tuned Linear Regression & LSTM models.

Performance Evaluation â€“ Compared models using RMSE and plotted prediction graphs.

Insights â€“ LSTM handled trend patterns better than Linear Regression.

ðŸ›  Tech Stack

Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras

Environment: Google Colab

ðŸ“Œ Key Learnings

Applied time-series forecasting techniques in a real-world financial context.
